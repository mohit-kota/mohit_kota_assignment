# Question - 4
As discussed in the question 4 I have created a form on left side and entries list of form on right side as discussed
in the question 4 maintaining proper alignment .
I have created add , edit , update , delete , search functionality 
when i fill the form and click submit , it triggers add functionality and adds a new record in the entries table 
when edit is clicked i can manipulate data inplace in the entries table and make it updated by clicking update 
when delete is clicked i will delete data from the entries table 
Added scroll for the table if number of record increases
The input box below Entries Heading is respectively a search bar , when we try searching the records in the table it 
automatically filters the results based on input in searchbar . The above code is achived using localstorage
which can also be achieved using backend server .
